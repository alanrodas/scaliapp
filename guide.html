      <p>Scaliapp is a library to create CLI ready applications in Scala easily.</p>
      <article>
        <section>
          <h2>Installing</h2>
          <p>
            To add the library to your project you need to download the
            current version and add it in the library location of your
            choice.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center"><a href="downloads/scaliapp_2.11.jar" class="btn btn-success">Download the library</a></p>
          <p>
            Optionally, you may checkout the code from this repository
            and build the project using sbt to publish it to your local
            maven repository.
          </p>
          <p>Just run in a terminal.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone git@github.com:alanrodas/scaliapp.git
cd scaliapp
sbt publishLocal</code></pre>
          <p>
            Then, you should be able to use it by any program using sbt
            in your local machine. Or, you can grab the .jar file from
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">~/.ivy2/local/com.alanrodas/scaliapp_2.11/0.1/jars/scaliap_2.11.jar</code></pre>
          <p>Note that Scaliapp is built against Scala 2.11.</p>
          <p>
            If you want to compile it against another Scala version, you
            will need to change the build.sbt file in the project folder.
            Change the *scalaVersion* variable to the desired version,
            such as:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">scalaVersion := "2.11.2"</code></pre>
          <p>Then compile with sbt publish</p>
          <div class="callout callout-info">
            Future versions will hopefully be hosted in a maven repository so you can add it
            to your projects easily. Please be patience.

          <h2>Usage</h2>
          <p>
            After installing, you just need to do the following to your
            main object (MainApp for this example):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Import com.alanrodas.scaliapp._</li>
            <li>Make MainApp extend CLIApp</li>
            <li>
              Define your commands in the body of the MainApp object
              using the Scaliapp DSL.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You are all set. Now you just need to call you application
            with the arguments expected and everything should be working.
          </p>

          <h2>DSL</h2>
          <p>
            Scaliapp provides a simple set of functions and object
            builder in order to provide a simple way to define commands,
            arguments and flags in the body of the main object. This set
            of functions and methods end up generating a DSL like
            language that you can use to configure your application
            expected behavior when called from the command line with
            different sets of arguments.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Defining the short and long parameter signs</h4>
          <p>
            A command line application may expect a number of values to
            be passed to it, but also a set of arguments and flags
            (parameters) that may be used to modify the behavior of the
            application. Common examples are the --force or -f
            modifiers, or the --verbose or -v.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it can be seen, this parameters take a special sign
            before their identifier. This sign is what identifies a
            parameter, and distinguish it from a value pass to the
            command. In unix systems the sign for short parameters (that
            is, one letter only) is "-" (dash). Windows systems usually
            use the "/" sign (slash) for this parameters. For long name
            parameters (more than one character), a double dash is used
            in unix systems ("--") while the same slash is used in
            windows ("/").
          </p>
          <p>
            Scaliapp allows you to change the long and short signs used
            by the application by overriding the longParamSign and the
            shortParamSign variables defined in CLIApp.
          </p>
          <p>
            So to change it, just assign your desired sign as the
            following example:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">object MainApp extends CLIApp {
	longParamSign = "/"
	shortParamSign = "/"
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Scaliapp uses the unix standard as a default, no matter if
            you are in a Windows or a Unix system.
          </p>
          <div class="callout callout-warning">
            In the rest of the document you will find references to
            flags and arguments called in the UNIX format ("-" and "--"),
            but be aware that this can be changed if you wish with the
            aforementioned variables.
          </div>
          <div class="callout callout-info">
            Future versions may default to the OS specific default, but

          <h4>Defining flags</h4>
          <p>
            A flag is a boolean value that is passed to the application
            in the form of a parameter. Common examples of flags in a
            command line app are verbose or force which also have their
            short versions as v and f. Flags may be created by the flag
            function that is in scope when importing Scaliapp.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flag function returns a builder object that needs to be
            configured correctly in order to properly define a flag as
            you want it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following is a flag definition for verbose that can be
            called as --verbose or as -v:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">flag named "verbose" alias "v" as false</code></pre>
          <p>The following is also valid and defines the same thing</p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">flag named "v" alias "verbose" as false</code></pre>
          <p>
            The name is always needed, but the alias may be omitted.
            The as method build the actual flag definition to use, and
            sets it's default value. Most flags default to false, but
            in rare occasions, true may be the desired default value.
          </p>
          <p>Here is a last example of a flag -f that defaults to true.</p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">flag named "f" as true</code></pre>
          <p>
            Flags are then added to a command definition so that, when
            called from the command line, those arguments are checked
            for existence. If they were defined, the opposite of the
            default defined is returned when asking for it's value.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Defining arguments</h4>
          <p>
            Arguments are pretty much like flags, but they may take
            additional values which may need or not to be present.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider for example the argument "-m" in the git commit
            command. This command takes one argument, that is the commit
            message. The commit message cannot be omitted, so it has no
            default value. An argument such as that will be defined as:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">arg named "m" taking 1 value</code></pre>
          <div class="callout callout-warning">
            <h4>WARNING</h4>
            <p>
              If the argument is expected to take more than one
              argument, then values may be used instead of values.
              Both methods are analogous and the two versions are
              provided just for readability. For example:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-scala">arg named "m" taking 1 values</code></pre>
            <p>Defines exactly the same argument as above.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            When an argument takes a value that can be omitted,
            you may specify a default value to it with the as method,
            and providing a list of the default values. Consider a
            command that takes a number, and returns the number
            converted in an ordering. So (1 -> 1st, 2 -> 2nd, 3 -> 3rd,
            4 -> 4th, 5 -> 5th, and so on).
          </p>
          <p>
            The argument *ordSuffix* determines the values appended
            to the four first elements if given. The default values
            should be english versions, so "st", "nd", "rd" and "th"
            will be used if this argument is not passed. Such an
            argument will be defined as:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">arg named "ordSuffix" taking 4 as List("st", "nd", "rd", "th")</code></pre>
          <p>The command with such an argument may be later called as:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">$ command 5
5th</code></pre>
          <p>or as:
            <pre><code class="language-bash">$ command 5 --ordSuffix ro do ro to
5to</code></pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            A last possibility for arguments is that they expect a
            set of mandatory values, and a set of optional ones later.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may define this kind of argument by just passing
            less values than the amount taken by the arguments to
            the default. Let's take the example of "oneMandatoryTwoOptional"
            This argument takes 3 values, one of which is mandatory, and
            the other two are optional. This will be defined as:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">arg named "oneMandatoryTwoOptional" taking 3 as List("second", "third")</code></pre>
          <p>
            The second and third values will be used if the command
            is called as:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">command --oneMandatoryTwoOptional first</code></pre>
          <p>
            But one value should always be passed to the argument,
            or an error will raise.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Defining values</h4>
          <p>
            Some commands expect a specific amount of values passed to
            them. This values may be mandatory, or optional and have a
            default value.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example is the *git push* command, which expects a
            "target" repository and a "branch" as optional values that
            default to "origin" and "master" respectively (I know that
            this is not exactly true, but please allow me to simplify
            "git push" behavior for the sake of this guide)
          </p>
          <p>
            So, a value for this cases also have a name and a default
            value. Such values may be defined with the value function,
            and configuring the name and the default value. See the
            following example:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">value named "target" as 'origin'</code></pre>
          <p>
            If you expect a mandatory value, then use "mandatory" to
            build the value instead of "as", as shown in the following
            example:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">value named "fileName" mandatory</code></pre>
          <p>
            When adding values to a command definition you should
            consider that the expected order is that the mandatory
            values are added first. If you don't follow the right order
            an exception warning about an incorrect declaration will
            raise.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Defining commands</h4>
          <p>
            Command are the main unit of execution in Scaliapp. Whenever
            you execute an application built with Scaliapp, a command is
            executed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each command contains it's own set of flags, arguments and
            values as well as a callback function to executed when
            called. There are two kind of commands, a named command,
            that is, with a specific name given (Can be multiple one in
            an application given that the names are not duplicated), and
            the root command (Only one in the application).
          </p>
          <p>
            For creating the root command the "root" function is
            provided by Scaliapp. This command expects an implicit
            CommandManager which is provided by CLIApp. We will focus
            on the root case first, and see the named command examples
            later on.
          </p>
          <div class="callout callout-info">
            <If>you do not want to extend CLIApp in your application, you</If>
            <can>still make use of Scaliapp. Just instantiate a</can>
            <CommandManager>as an implicit value wherever you want to</CommandManager>
            <define>your commands use the "setSigns" method to configure</define>
            <the>long and short signs (only if you are not planning to</the>
            <use>the defaults) and then call "execute" on it with the</use>
            <values>that your application was run with.</values>
          </div>
          <p>So, if you want to call your application as </p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">myApp <fileName> [-f | --force][-v | --verbose]</code></pre>
          <p>
            with optional flags -v or --verbose and -f or --force and
            that takes one mandatory value by the name of "fileName",
            you should use the following code in order to instantiate
            the command:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">root accepts
	(flag named "verbose" alias "v" as false) accepts
	(flag named "force" alias "f" as false) receives
	(value named "fileName" mandatory) does {command =>
		// Your action to perform on command call here
}</code></pre>
          <p>
             "accepts" method in the CommandBuilder defines the flags
             and arguments for the command. You may call "accepts" with
             just one parameter or with a sequence of parameters. If you
             are planning to support a large set of parameters, it will
             be better to use the sequence form, as it's cleaner. The
             same goes for values, that are added with the "receives"
             method, and can also take a sequence of values instead of
             just one. That said, the following code defines exactly
             the same command as before:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">root accepts Seq(
	flag named "verbose" alias "v" as false,
	flag named "force" alias "f" as false
) receives Seq(
	value named "fileName" mandatory
) does {command =>
	// Your action to perform on command call here
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            The "does" method takes the function to execute when this
            command is called and also constructs the actual command
            from the builder. We will return to this command in a later
            section, for now, just consider that you need to have the
            "does" method at the end of your command definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, your command may take a unlimited number of
            values. Consider for example, the "rm" command in unix,
            which takes any amount of file names, and deletes them.
            For this cases, you may want to use the "multipleValues"
            method instead of "receives". This method tells Scaliapp
            that this command takes an unlimited number of values. So,
            an "rm" like command will be defined as:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">root accepts Seq(
	flag named "force" alias "f" as false
) multipleValues does {command =>
	// Your action to perform on command call here
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            In this case, we are defining the command to accept an
            unlimited number of values, but we may want to declare an
            expected minimum or maximum amount of values. For example
            "rm" needs at least one file name to be passed. This can be
            achieves with "minimumOf" and "maximumOf" methods. So for a
            command that takes one or more values, you may define it as:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">root accepts Seq(
	flag named "force" alias "f" as false
) multipleValues minimumOf 1 does {command =>
	// Your action to perform on command call here
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            For the sake of simplicity, you may avoid the
            "multipleValues" method if you have a minimum or maximum
            defined, so the above becomes:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">root accepts Seq(
	flag named "force" alias "f" as false
) minimumOf 1 does {command =>
	// Your action to perform on command call here
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Instead of having multiple applications and delegate the
            passed arguments, you may have one applications with
            multiple commands. This is where named commands comes in.
            Command in the form of "git push" or "git add" may be
            defined as named commands "push" and "add".
          </p>
          <div class="callout callout-info">
            Of course nothing stops you from delegating to a second
            application if you wish, but you are not forced to do so.
          </div>
          <p>
            A named command may be defined with the "command" function,
            and setting it's name with the "named" method. This commands
            can then be configured as the previously seen commands. Here
            is an example of "push" and "add" commands.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">command named "push" accepts Seq(
	flag named "verbose" alias "v" as false,
	flag named "quiet" alias "q" as false,
	flag named "dry-run" alias "n" as false,
	flag named "force" alias "f" as false,
	arg named "repo" taking 1 value,
	arg named "recurse-submodules" taking 1 as List("check"),
	arg named "exec" taking 1 value
) receives Seq(
	value named "target" as "origin",
	value named "branch" as "master"
) does { commandCall =>
	// Your action to perform on command call here
}
command named "add" accepts Seq(
	flag named "quiet" alias "q" as false,
	flag named "dry-run" alias "n" as false,
	flag named "force" alias "f" as false,
	flag named "intent-to-add" alias "N" as false,
	flag named "all" alias "A" as false
) minimumOf 1 does { commandCall =>
	// Your action to perform on command call here
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            This previous sample pretty much sums up what you can define
            as a command in Scaliapp.

          <h2>Performing actions and using the data</h2>
          <p>
            As we have seen, each command takes a function in the "does"
            method that is the function to call when that given command
            is called. This function takes a "Command", which holds all
            the values passed to the command by the user, as well as the
            default values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically you should want to analyze the values passed to
            your function. The following operations can be performed in
            order to access the data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>allFlags</b><em>(Returns all the flags defined for this command)</em></li>
            <li><b>allArguments</b><em>(Returns all arguments defined for this command)</em></li>
            <li><b>flag(name : String)</b><em>(Returns the flag by the name or alias "name")</em></li>
            <li><b>argument(name : String)</b><em>(Returns the argument by the name or alias "name")</em></li>
            <li><b>flagPassed(name : String)</b><em>(Returns true if the flag by the name or alias "name" has been passed by the user)</em></li>
            <li><b>argumentPassed(name : String)</b><em>(Returns true if the argument by the name or alias "name" has been passed by the user)</em></li>
            <li><b>flagValue(name : String)</b><em>(Returns the value of the flag by the name or alias "name")</em></li>
            <li><b>argumentValue(name : String)</b><em>(Returns the value of the sbtargument by the name or alias "name")</em></li>
            <li><b>name</b><em>(Returns the name of the called command)</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, if the command takes a defined set of values
            that are identified by name you can use the following set of
            methods to access the values:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>allValues</b><em>(Returns all the values for this command)</em></li>
            <li><b>value(name : String)</b><em>(Returns the value by the name or alias "name")</em></li>
            <li><b>valuePassed(name : String)</b><em>(Returns true if the value by the name "name" has been passed by the user)</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If the command takes an unlimited number of values, you can
            get them with the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>allValues</b><em>(Returns all the values for this command)</em></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Exceptions</h2>
          <p>
            Scaliapp throws a set of different exceptions in different
            occasions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scaliapp will throw an InvalidCommandDefinition if any
            defined command is invalid. This will happen if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any parameter does not have a name.</li>
            <li>There are two commands with the same name.</li>
            <li>There are two parameters with the same name or alias.</li>
            <li>A mandatory value is defined after an optional value.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Scaliapp also throws two other kind of errors. An
            InvalidCommandCall is thrown when the set of arguments used
            to call the application is not a valid one
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A parameter that was not defined was passed</li>
            <li>The minimum number of values was not met</li>
            <li>The maximum number of values was exceeded</li>
            <li>
              There is no root command and the first argument passed
              does not match any defined command name
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This last case will throw a NotFoundCommand exception, which
            is a special case of InvalidCommandCall.
          </p>
          <div class="callout callout-info">
            This kind of exceptions are catched by CLIApp and a special
            action is performed. You can set the function to execute in
            case the command was not found, or in case the command call
            is invalid.
          </div>
          <p>
            The third kind of exception thrown is an AbstractInvalidName,
            which is thrown when you want to access a value or parameter
            with a name that does not exists.

          <h2>Handling Exceptions</h2>
          <p>
            The CLIApp trait provides two variables, "onCommandNotFound"
            and "onInvalidCommandCall". This variables are of the type
            "NotFoundCommand => Unit" and "InvalidCommandCall => Unit"
            respectively. These functions are executed when an error of
            the former types is raised, so you can take a specific
            action in case a command call was invalid. By default, the
            "onCommandNotFound" and "onInvalidCommandCall" just outpu
            to the console the error message with a nice red color. If
            you want you can modify these functions in order to perform
            a more specific action.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-scala">object MainApp extends CLIApp {
	onCommandNotFound = {e => printGeneralHelp()}
	onInvalidCommandCall = {e => printHelpFor(e.command)}
